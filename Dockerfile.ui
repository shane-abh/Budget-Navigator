# --- FIX START ---

# 1. Copy ONLY package files first. 
# This allows Docker to cache the "npm install" layer. 
# If you change your code but not your dependencies, Docker skips the install step!
COPY ["ui/Tax RAG/package.json", "ui/Tax RAG/package-lock.json", "./"]

# 2. Install ALL dependencies (including devDependencies like TypeScript)
RUN npm ci --include=dev

# 3. Copy the rest of the application code
COPY ["ui/Tax RAG/", "./"]

# --- FIX END ---

# Build the application
RUN npm run build
